# vectorspacemodel
A strongly-typed, light-weight library created in TypeScript that allows for an object-orientated, high-level, efficient approach to Vector Space Model computations.

## Features
* A convenient library of Information Retrieval (IR) functions, such as
  * term frequency: `termFrequency`
  * document frequency: `documentFrequency`
  * inverse document frequency: `inverseDocumentFrequency`

## Usage
```

```

## An Apology
_Yes_, the names of classes, interfaces, and functions are _very_ long at times, but often times, abbreviations cause for confusions, ambiguity, and difficulty reading code. I am always open to new suggestions for new naming schema, so please open an issue if you have concerns.
